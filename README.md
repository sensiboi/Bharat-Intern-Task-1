## House Price Prediction

This repository contains a project on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a linear regression model.
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. Accurate house price prediction is critical for various stakeholders, including real estate agents, buyers, sellers, and investors. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and other amenities. The process begins with data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and relationships. Categorical data is then converted into numerical form using label encoding. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the linear regression model. The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error(MAE). This project demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in the real estate domain, providing insights and predictions that can aid in decision-making.
